**Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020**

The 2020 Annual Developer Survey assesses all aspects of a developer's experience, from education to job search and career satisfaction. About 65,000 developers from 180 countries participated in the survey, which took place between February 5 and 28, 2020.    

The purpose of the analysis was to extract insights about the **career in technology**, therefore, only the data of the participants who declared to work professionally in the area ('I am a developer by profession') were analyzed.

## Job Satisfaction    
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data to better understand:    
      
* The level of professional satisfaction of the developers.
* Factors that influence job satisfaction levels.
* The reasons that lead a developer to look for another job.
* What kind of influence does the satisfaction level have on the reasons for seeking a new professional opportunity.
